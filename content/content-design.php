        <p>
            I hold a Master's degree in Media Design from <a href="https://www.fullsail.edu/">Full Sail University</a> and in 2016
            I was given a chance to put it to practical use by designing 3 new English
            language textbooks for use in the Korean university I teach at. The books
            were written entirely by my colleagues (though I added an article to the third one,
            Practical English Reading), but I created all the layout and design.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was definitely a great opportunity for me to stretch my design skills in
            a little different way and create a commercial product like this.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the 3 textbooks, I also led a high school class through the
            process of creating a <a href="http://gpa.justkeeplearning.xyz/yearbook">yearbook</a>. Each student (13) contributed 1-2 pages of
            the final design based on InDesign templates I prepared for them to use.
            Then, I put together the final 100-page design.

              In order to make the school's website more helpful for both prospective
              (English-speaking) students and parents, and current staff,
              I took archived content from our old WordPress site and combined
              it with the Teacher's Manual and additional English content we'd only been using
              internally. Now, I'm working on synching this version of the site with
              our current Google Apps for Education accounts and replacing the old
              English site with this one.

              Previously, the Yearbook had been created entirely by an after-school
              activity program that met twice per week. That club used MS Publisher
              to create the Yearbook.
            </p>
            <p class="article-description">
              However, in Spring 2016, for the first time, Yearbook became a semester-long
              class. I led the students through an Intro to Graphic Design
              course and created the Yearbook in Adobe InDesign. This class was successful
              enough that it is being offered again for Spring 2017.

              Another new course offering at GPA was called "Graphic Design" and
              offered in the Fall 2016 semester. Rather than rehashing what I'd
              previously taught in the Yearbook class, I decided to teach students
              the fundamentals of Graphic Design by choosing their own company to
              fully rebrand (logo, posters, wearables, and so on).
            </p>
            <p class="article-description">
              Whereas Yearbook focused primarily on Adobe InDesign, this Graphic
              Design course focused primarily on Adobe Illustrator. (GPA also
              offers a course on Photoshop, taught by the Art teacher.)

              One of my friends in Jeonju who runs a Study Cafe asked me at the beginning
              of the year to help him rebrand his Cafe as they transitioned to a new
              location and business model. I wanted to update the logo and design style
              without straying too far from the original. This design is what I came up
              with.
